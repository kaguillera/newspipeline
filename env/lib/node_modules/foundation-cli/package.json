  "readme": "# Foundation CLI\n\nThis is the command-line interface for [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) family of frameworks.. It downloads and installs blank templates in any of the three Foundation frameworks:\n\n- [Foundation for Sites](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites), a framework for responsive websites.\n- [Foundation for Apps](http://foundation.zurb.com/apps), a framework for responsive web apps.\n- [Foundation for Emails](http://foundation.zurb.com/emails), a framework for responsive email.\n\n## Requirements\n\nYou'll need the following software installed to get started.\n\n  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) 0.12+: Use the installer provided on the NodeJS website.\n    * With Node installed, run `[sudo] npm install -g gulp bower`.\n  * [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads): Use the installer for your OS.\n    * Windows users can also try [Git for Windows](http://git-for-windows.github.io/).\n\n## Installing\n\nThe Foundation CLI is installed through npm.\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g foundation-cli\n```\n\nThis will add the `foundation` command to your system.\n\n### Updating\n\nThe CLI periodically gets updates that add features or fix bugs. Use npm to upgrade the CLI to the newest version.\n\n```bash\nnpm update -g foundation-cli\n```\n\nTo check what version you currently have, use `-v`.\n\n```bash\nfoundation -v\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n### New\n\nStarts the setup process for a new Foundation project. The CLI will ask you which framework you want to use and a folder name for the project.\n\n```bash\nfoundation new\n```\n\n### Watch\n\nWhile inside of your app's folder, use the `watch` command to assemble your app and run a test server.\n\n```bash\ncd appName\nfoundation watch\n```\n\nWhile this process is running, you can view the assembled app in your browser, at this URL:\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:8080\n```\n\nWhile the server is running, any changes you make to your HTML, Sass, or JavaScript will automatically be processed and added to your live app.\n\n### Build\n\nTo build your app for production, use `foundation build`.\n\n```bash\nfoundation build\n```\n\n### Update\n\nUpdates your Bower packages, which includes Foundation. Run this command when you want to update an existing project to the newest version of Foundation.\n\n```bash\nfoundation update\n```\n\n### Help\n\nLists all available commands in the CLI.\n\n```bash\nfoundation help\n```\n\nAdd a command name at the end to learn how a specific command works.\n\n```bash\nfoundation help new\n```\n",
