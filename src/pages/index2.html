## My Responsive Email <small>With a nice, centered title</small>

Everything markdown is converted automatically into a responsive email template powered by [Zurb’s Ink framework](http://zurb.com/ink/ "Ink is awesome!").

## Easy columns, no more tables

<row>

    <column>
        Since Markdown isn’t a layout tool, you cannot use it to generate columns. Instead, I introduced HTML-esque tags that allow you to create columns on the fly.

    </column>
    <column>
    
Using the `row` tag, you specify that the content inbetween will be a row. 

    </column>
    <column>

Using the `column` tag between 2 `row` tags will automatically separate the content into 2 columns. There is a maximum of 4 columns on the same row.
    
    </column>
</row>

## Buttons for everybody

<row>

Buttons take the width of the column.

<button>
[This is a link](http://www.google.com "Link to Google")
</button>

Or rounded corners.

<button-rounded>
[This is a link](http://www.google.com "Link to Google")
</button-rounded>

Or round corners.

<button-round>
[This is a link](http://www.google.com "Link to Google")
</button-round>

<column>

They can have square corners. 

<button>
[This is a link](http://www.google.com "Link to Google")
</button>

Yup.

<button-rounded>
[This is a link](http://www.google.com "Link to Google")
</button-rounded>

Yup.

<button-round>
[This is a link](http://www.google.com "Link to Google")
</button-round>

</row>

## Images

<!-- Yes, you can use some HTML and it won’t break. But it’s at your own risk :) -->

 **#protip** <span style="color:#999;"> For the first image, I will use a `row` tag with no column just to keep the padding between the 3 pictures consistent. </span>

<row>

![A beautiful cat!](http://cakedown.alexandredeschamps.ca/assets/img/p1.jpg "Cat!")

</row>

<row>

![A beautiful cat!](http://cakedown.alexandredeschamps.ca/assets/img/p2.jpg "Cat!")

<column>

![A beautiful cat!](http://cakedown.alexandredeschamps.ca/assets/img/p3.jpg "Cat!")

</row>

## Lists

<row>

### Ordered list

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
4. Item 4

<column>

### Unordered list

* Something
* Something else
* Another thing
* Whatever

</row>

*Note: Here’s a cool way to use italics!*

***

## Paragraph modifiers

You can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.

#### Quotes!

> Wow, I can even quote people!
