# Response esponsive Email With a nice, centered title

Everything markdown is converted automatically into a responsive email template powered by [Zurb’s Ink framework](http://zurb.com/ink/ "Ink is awesome!").

## Easy columns, no more tables


Since Markdown isn’t a layout tool, you cannot use it to generate columns. Instead, I introduced HTML-esque tags that allow you to create columns on the fly.


Using the `row` tag, you specify that the content inbetween will be a row. 


Using the `column` tag between 2 `row` tags will automatically separate the content into 2 columns. There is a maximum of 4 columns on the same row.

### Ordered list

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
4. Item 4


### Unordered list

* Something
* Something else
* Another thing
* Whatever

> Wow, I can even quote people!
