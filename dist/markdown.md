# Response esponsive Email With a nice, centered title

Everything markdown is converted automatically into a responsive email template powered by [Zurb&#x2019;s Ink framework](http://zurb.com/ink/ &quot;Ink is awesome!&quot;).

## Easy columns, no more tables


Since Markdown isn&#x2019;t a layout tool, you cannot use it to generate columns. Instead, I introduced HTML-esque tags that allow you to create columns on the fly.


Using the `row` tag, you specify that the content inbetween will be a row. 


Using the `column` tag between 2 `row` tags will automatically separate the content into 2 columns. There is a maximum of 4 columns on the same row.
